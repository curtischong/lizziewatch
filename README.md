# Heart Control

Monitor your heart rate on the apple watch - continuously and easy.

## What is it?

Heart Control is a standalone watch app to monitor continuously heart rate on [watchOS 3](http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/). It collects and analyzes data in real-time in the background.

## What is it not?

It's not a whole implementation of every little detail of [Apple's HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/). It's more or less a quick start guide for workout apps on watchOS 3.
